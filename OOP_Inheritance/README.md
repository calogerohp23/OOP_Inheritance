# POO - Inheritance Practice

This is a practice to demonstrate an evaluate Inheritance skills.

On this practice we will have two exercises:

1. Exercise_1 (School)
They give us a school. The school has classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers. Each teacher teaches a set of courses. Students have a name and a unique number in the class. Classes have a unique text identifier. The teachers have names. The courses have a name, class count and exercise count. Both teachers and students are people.

Your task is to develop the classes (in object-oriented programming terms) along with their attributes and operations/

* Define the class hierarchy
* Create a class diagram.

2. Exercie_2 (Shape Inheritance)
Define an abstract Shape class with the CalculateSurface() abstract method and the width and height fields. Define two additional classes for a triangle and a rectangle, which implement CalculateSurface(). This method has to return the areas of the rectangle (height*width) and the triangle (height*width/2).  Define a class for a Circle with an appropriate constructor, which initializes the two fields (height and width) with the same value (the radius) and implements the abstract method to calculate the area. Create an array of different Shapes and calculate the area of ​​each shape in another array.
